# Lore
If you are reading this, you are the ~~un~~lucky few that have been given an invitation to play on my Friends and Family Server. The server is a namesake from an old friend group of mine inspired by the Mafia Boss ad meme. Fitting for the name of the server, as in minecraft, you start out a low leveled goon and climb your way up to become the mafia boss, I decided to use it.
# Details
This is a vanilla plus server with some quality of life addons which are:
- To Be Added :\)
# How to Join
You'll need to add this page's URL to the server list in your minecraft client and follow the instructions on [ygg.nathancs.dev](https://ygg.nathancs.dev) as this site uses a custom authentication server seperate from Mojang.
If you haven't received an invite URL to create an account, you know me personally, so just drop me a chat and I'll give you one if I haven't already (Working on a mailing system to automatically create these, but for now the manual way should do). You can manage your skins using the account website, or you can create a [Ely.by](https://ely.by) account and use that instead to provide you with the skins, just don't forget to register using this account during the account creation.
# Server Etiquette
There are some rules to note of when playing on this server:
- This server will be available to all my friends and family, so I would prefer it if you didn't grief each other.
- Anyone up to 3 degrees of separation is allowed on this server, so say you are a friend, your spouse and her friends will be allowed to play on this server, just request an invite, but please don't spam me and try to request in bulk if there are a lot of people.
- You can request features and plugins as long as it is within the "Vanilla Plus" theme. I will consider adding more servers for other modes \(Skyblock?\) if the time permits :O
- Please don't use hacked clients, more suggestion than rule. Let's help everyone have fun. Hard rule: If you must use hacked clients, don't use it to grief others, you will be banned for this. (Just report these to me if you were negatively affected)
